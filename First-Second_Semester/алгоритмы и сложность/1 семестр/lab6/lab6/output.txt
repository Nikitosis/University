	For many decades, scientists believed the earliest humans
originated in East Africa. This belief has changed because
of a collection of 2.4-million-year-old stone tools
found in Algeria. Scientists now believe that Algeria
and not East Africa is the cradle of civilization -
where humankind began. The new find consists of 250
tools. There were also 296 animal bones. The scientists
say the animal bones show that early humans were butchering
meat. Dr Mohamed Sahnouni, leader of the project, said:
"The evidence from Algeria changes the earlier view
that East Africa was the cradle of humankind." He added:
"Actually, the whole of Africa was the cradle of humankind."





	Archaeologists have been digging at various sites on
this project for 25 years. The sharp-edged tools and
bones were discovered near the city of Setif, about
200 miles east of Algeria's capital, Algiers. In particular,
the animal bones excited the scientists. Dr Sahnouni
said it is now clear that humans were butchering animals
for meat 600,000 years earlier than previously thought.
A Spanish archaeologist said: "The effective use of
sharp-edged tools ...suggests that our ancestors were
not mere scavengers." She said it wasn't clear whether
or not they hunted, but they did compete with other
animals to get access to meat. Dr Sahnouni now hopes
to find the tool-makers and even older stone tools.
